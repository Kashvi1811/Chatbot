## 📌 Project Overview  
This repository contains a simple chatbot designed to answer questions based on short stories using Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning techniques. By training on a custom dataset (inspired by the bAbI dataset), the model learns to understand context and provide relevant answers. The goal is to simulate conversational intelligence in a structured Q&A format.


## 🎯 What This Project Offers  

**Contextual Q&A Modeling:**  
Learns from story-question-answer triplets and predicts appropriate answers using LSTM networks.

**Custom Dataset Handling:**  
Processes raw pickled datasets (`train_qa.txt.txt`, `test_qa.txt.txt`) and builds vocabulary from scratch.

**Deep Learning Pipeline:**  
Implements a Keras-based model architecture for sequence learning and attention-like querying.

**Hands-on NLP Workflow:**  
Tokenization, sequence padding, data preprocessing, and vocabulary generation from scratch.

**Beginner-Friendly Notebook:**  
Step-by-step code in a clean and commented Jupyter Notebook format for easy learning and experimentation.

## 🚀 Getting Started  

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kashvi1811/ChatBot-QA.git
cd ChatBot-QA
```

Optional: Set up a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate    # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
```

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## 🛠️ How to Use  

**1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:**

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

**2. Open the file:**
```
Chatbot code.ipynb
```

**3. Run All Cells:**

- Loads and preprocesses training/testing data
- Builds the vocabulary and tokenizes input
- Constructs, trains, and evaluates the chatbot model
- Make predictions using custom stories/questions

**4. Customize:**

- Modify the dataset with your own story-based Q&A pairs  
- Try experimenting with hyperparameters and architecture
